**File Hider**: a file steganography tool for hiding files within other files. Written in Java with JavaFX for the GUI.

**EZcrypt**: a file encryption/decryption tool. Written in Java with JavaFX for the GUI.

**Intro to security**: a short book about information security. Uses Markdown for the chapters.

**ChiWeather**: a bot that gets weather data for Chicago using a weather API. It also uses FTP to download a photo of the sky taken on another device. It then uses the Twitter API to send a tweet that contains weather data. Written in Python and Bash. It has two separate components: one for taking the photo on a Raspberry Pi Zero (written in Bash), and another for building and sending the tweet (Python).

**Java weather API tool**: a tool for downloading and saving weather data. Written in Java.

**PHP web shell**: a website security tool written in PHP.

**Prime Finder**: a program that finds primes and gaps between primes, and then graphs the data. It can save its place and then quit and resume later. Written in C++ and gnuplot.

**Youtube Bulk Downloader**: a tool that lets you download a lot of Youtube videos all at once for offline viewing. It's a shell script.

**AMP**: Alan's Maintenance Program. A shell script for automating Linux tasks, such as installing software updates, testing the network connection, and scanning for malware.

**0x416c616e.github.io / alans100daysofcode.com**: a Jekyll-based blog. Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby (which I didn't make).

**Static Site Generator**: I was frustrated with some of the quirks of Jekyll (needing specific versions of dependencies and getting errors), so I made my own simple static site generator instead. Written in Python.

**Software development book**: a book about software development in a variety of languages.

**Unnamed 2D game engine**: a 2-dimensional game engine for RPG games. It features tile-based movement and collision detection, as well as 2D graphics. It also has a level editor. Written in Java and uses JavaFX for the GUI.

**Tech quotes**: a project that randomly displays tech quotes from famous people in tech. Written in JavaScript.

**Saint Louis Software website**: a static website with basic information about who I am, what my education is, and what I can do. Made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, etc. Primarily a front-end development project.

**Various Wordpress websites**: I've made sites with Wordpress, a popular LAMP-based content management system. Examples: Hello Life Skills and Smart Financial Research.

**File servers**: I've set up file servers with FreeNAS and ZFS for SMB file sharing. I've set up user accounts and permissions so that people can access their own files, but not other people's. Primarily used for Windows desktop file backups.

**Customer routers**: I've set up routers with pfSense and DD-WRT.

**Server rack project**: built some servers and a network. Set up all the physical stuff as well as software. Currently, there are two hypervisors on it, and many other computers that I have yet to set up, but plan on eventually setting up as a Kubernetes cluster for containers. 

**Future projects**: I want to concentrate on full stack LAMP development (web dev), using cloud providers for hosting my web projects, interacting with databases, publishing my book, and information security. My first major LAMP project might be a to-do list program. I will also be doing a Java-based database project this semester in the database class, writing a Java front-end program to interact with a database.
